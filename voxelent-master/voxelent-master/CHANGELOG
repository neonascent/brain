-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.89.5 - Work in progress
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

KEY ACTIONS
------------

Now keys can be programmed to perform customized operations. See demo-camera-management.html: 


view.interactor.addKeyAction('W', function()....)
view.interactor.addKeyAction('N', function()....)

key actions are enabled by default. Key actions can be disabled with:

view.interactor.enableKeyActions(false);


DISABLING FULLSCREEN MODE
--------------------------

Fullscreen mode can be enabled/disabled with:

view.enableFullScreen()
view.disableFullScreen()

these instructions don't take the view to fullscreen mode but instead control how the view
answers fullscreen requests.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.89.4 - EXTERNAL SHADERS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXTERNAL SHADERS
---------------------------
In this version we are making possible to design and use your own shaders by embedding
ESSL code in a voxelent web page.

please check the demo-bouncing-balls.html code to see how this is possible.

CHANGES TO PROGRAMS
-----------------------------
the new class vxlProgram represents a one to one mapping between a JavaScript object and a ESSL program

the old vxlProgram class has been renamed to vxlProgramManager given that its operations deal
with handling actual ESSL programs.


ENFORCING PROGRAMS
---------------------------------

vxl.api.setProgram(view, vxl.def.glsl.lambert)

is replaced instead by:

vxl.api.setProgram(view, vxl.go.essl.lambert);


Other programs available in this version are:

vxlBlenderProgram (vxl.go.essl.blender), 
vxlBakeProgram (vxl.go.essl.bake), 
vxlPhongProgram (vxl.go.essl.phong)

When vxl.api.setProgram is used, the program is enforced (actors can't override the program of current use)
until the program is released using
vxl.api.releaseProgram()

NEW CLASSES
----------------------------------------
vxlEngine: defines the minimum set of actions an engine should have
vxlExternalEngine: used when the programs are defined on the hosting web page 
vxlProgram: provides operations to load programs using DOM, JSON, AJAX.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.89.3 - COMPLEX RENDERING: Renderables
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ACTOR UPDATES
-------------------

1. Some actor operations (property setters) now return the actor instance. 
This allows the chain of commands pattern:

for example:

var actor = vxl.c.scene.getActorByName('sphere');
actor.setColor(0.4,0.4,0.5).setPosition(3,3,3).setOpacity(0.5);

CAMERA UPDATES
-------------------------

1. The normal axis of the vxlCamera has been replaced by the forward axis. This is just a change
in syntax not in behaviour. This means that the internal property ._normal has been replaced by
the internal property ._forward.

2. Previous to this version, the camera object could not pass an elevation of 90 or -90 but instead
the movement was restricted to avoid 'oscliations' due to the inability to determine the up direction
this problem has been fixed by changing the code of the rotate method. The rotation now occurs
with respect to the current camera coordinates and every time the camera axes are recalculated. 

This mode of operation is captured by the vxl.def.camera.type.EXPLORING type which is now the mode
by default.

2. The methods lookAt(actor) and closeUp(actor) have been fixed!!

3. The paning and translating methods have been fixed. They were not using the correct "up" vector
after a 90 degree rotation.

4. Translation tracking is fixed!

TRACKER INTERACTOR UPDATES
-----------------------------
1. Now it is possible to use the Command key in Mac to perform dollying (zoom). It was tricky
to use the control key on mac because in some cases it triggers a pop up depending on the
browser version on Mac.

From this version on, if you have a Mac, you can use Command key + mouse drag to perform dollying.

PICKING
------------
1. The cell picker has been improved and the bug that it had has been corrected. (it was selecting
wrong cells in some cases).

2. Cell painting is much faster now (from 1.74 s down to 177ms). vxlCell.setColor()

ACTOR GROUPS
----------------
Actors can be associated and handled as a whole using the new class vxlActorGroup. To create
an actor group simply request it from the scene

var scene = vxl.c.scene;
var actorGroup = scene.createActorGroup("theNameOfTheActorGroup",listOfActors);

then you can do things such as:

actorGroup.setOpacity()
actorGroup.setProperty('propertyName', propertyValue)

Just like actor operations, actor group operations are chainable:

actorGroup.setOpacity(0.4).setColor(0.3,0.4,0.2)

API UPDATES
----------------

setProgram: new option to force it
getProgram: this might be variable if an actor decides to change program it will capture
the current program being used.

Neww methods:

setUniform(uniformName, value) -- affects the current program
setUniformDefault(programID, uniformName, value) -- not necessarily in the current program. 
                                                 -- overrides a value if the program has been loaded
getUniformList()

this way the programs can be configured from the API whether or not they are in use.

The phong and texture tests reflect these changes (see test-phong.html and test-texture.html)

HIGH RESOLUTION MODELS
--------------------------
1. Enabling flat shading and fast cell picking for high-res models.

Models can be of the type vxl.def.model.type:SIMPLE, MESH, BIG_DATA
This type identifies how much information has the model and how it should be treated by voxelent.

vxlRenderEngine will use this type to determine if there are needs for renderable parts (vxlRenderable).


MESH UPDATES
-------------
2. vxlCell now requires a reference to the vxlMesh it belongs and an index. This enables
fast updating of the vxlMesh model (for instance to change the color of a cell)

RENDERABLES
-------------------------

1. Renderables belong now to the vxlActor class. The idea behind it is to make sure that
the actor representation on screen is different from the model This way we can have several actors
based on the same model. Each one with different properties. For instance, two actors based on the
same model but each one using a different lookup table. To achieve this, it is necessary that the colors are stored in the material
of the actor (vxlMaterial) instead of using the vxlModel colors (which are used initially if they exist)

The vxlRenderable reads the model information from vxlMesh model if the actor has one
or from the actor model if it is of type big data.

ENGINE
-------------------------
vxlRenderStrategy has been renamed to vxlRenderEngine


LOADING VTK FILES USING AJAX
-----------------------------

1. Now the familiar vxl.api.load routine support VTK files too! 
Before this release, VTK files could only be added through drag and drop.


PERFORMANCE UPDATES
-------------------
1. Many for loops have been replaced by while loops counting down to zero. Classes updated:

vxlRenderEngine, vxlScene

2. Color matching in vxlPicker has been debugged and optimized


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.89.2 - UPDATES
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

API UPDATES
----------------------

New methods:
vxl.api.loadSequence('part',1,40,'/the/path');
vxl.api.solidWireframeON(true|false);
vxl.api.setFieldOfView(number [0-360]);

Removed methods:

vxl.api.setCameraDistance


MATERIALS
----------------------
The concept of material has been added to voxelent. (See vxlMaterial on jsdocs).

Each actor has now a material object that contains elements such as:

- opacity
- shininess
- diffuse color
- specular color
- ambient color
- texture
- shading

You can still change these properties through the respective set* methods in 
vxlActor, 

You can still query these propertyes through vxlActor.getProperty

Additionally you can access the material and set the properties directly, like in:

actor.material.shading = false






Merging Lambert and Phong strategies
----------------------------------------
1. vxlLambertStrategy, vxlPhongStrategy, vxlRenderStrategy and vxlBasicStrategy
are now merged into vxlRenderStrategy

2. In both vxl.api.setProgram and vxlRenderer.setProgram, the strategy now is optional.
By default, the new class vxlRenderStrategy has combined both the former lambert and phong strategies.

3. The vxl.def.glsl.phong and vxl.def.glsl.lambert are still current. 
You can use them with vxlRenderer.setProgram()


Actor shininess
-----------------

The actor shininess property has been defined. the default strategy evaluates this property
to decide the proper program to use (lambert vs phong). See vxlDefaultStrategy

actor.setShininess(100); //the lower the value the bigger the specular reflection
actor.setProperty('shininess',200); //also can be set this way


Update on vxlTexture
---------------------

1. The new methods setMagFilter and setMinFilter are available
2. vxlTexture controls the case where the texture can't be load (see vxlTexture._onError)



Object picking
----------------------
Now object picking is available as promised in 0.89.1. Use:

	actor.setPicker(vxl.def.actor.picking.OBJECT, callback)

where callback can be any function that receives two arguments:

	function whateverNameCallbackFunction(actor, uid)


Camera updates
---------------------

1. The methotd vxlCamera.setFieldOfView has been added, there is an accessible method on the API 
(see vxl.api.setFieldOfView)

3. LANDMARKS
The old vxlCameraState has been replaced by vxlLandmark
The new camera methods are available:

   - setLandmark
   - goTo
   - getLandmarks
   
   



-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.89.1 - Lots of stuff
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

document_plexo.py has been renamed to document.py now all the subprojects get documented at the same 
time so we don't miss anything.

New classes in Nucleo
----------------------
vxlMesh: enables cell by cell operations (triangles) on raw geometry (model)
vxlCell: elements of a vxlMesh
vxlPicker: handles picking


New classes in Plexo
----------------------
vxlDataStreamReader : encapsulates a data source
   |
   + -- vxlJSONReader: reads a JSON data source

New classes in Nucleo
----------------------
vxlMesh
vxlCell
vxlPicker
vxlPickerInteractor
vxlRenderTarget

Actor Updates
---------------

1. Face culling
vxlActor supports now back face and front face culling:

var actor = vxl.c.scene.getActorByName('sphere'); //from the current scene
actor.cullFace(vxl.def.actor.cull.BACK); //hides the back face.

2. New actor visualization methods

Now actors can be visualized with the wireframe overlaid on top of the solid geometry:

actor.setVisualizationMode(vxl.def.actor.mode.WIRED_AND_SOLID)

Also flat shading is available:
actor.setVisualizationMode(vxl.def.actor.mode.FLAT)

   
Picking API
-------------

Picking is available at the object and cell levels:

actor._picking = vxl.def.actor.picking.CELL
                 vxl.def.actor.picking.OBJECT (to be implemented in the follwing update)
                 vxl.def.actor.picking.DISABLED
                 

actor.setPicker(type, callback)

actor.isPickable() : returns true if actor._picking != vxl.def.actor.picking.DISABLED

vxlPickerInteractor
---------------------
the vxlPickerInteractor is fully implemented. An example of how to use it is in the test-cell-picking.html file under demos 

Strategy Pattern
------------------
The lambert and phong strategies are going to be merged in the next version. In this version
you can see the intense effort made to make the lambert strategy more readable and easy to debug.




-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.89 - Crocodile Rock - Elton John
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
API Updates
------------------
1. New API methods getActor, getActorByUID, getProgram
2. Actors and models names are stripped from the '.json' suffix.

Model Updates
------------------
1.New model method getBoundingBoxVertices
2.New model static method BB_INDICES


Actor Updates
--------------
1. New visualization mode for actors (BOUNDING BOX). Check vxl.def.actor.mode
   Phong and Lambert strategies updated to be able to render actor bounding boxes

2. New actor method getHeight (it behaves nicely after actor rotation/scaling always returning y-length of bounding box)

3. Actors hold now an internal matrix to represent geometric transformations (i.e. rotation, translations, scaling)
   Position, Scale and Rotation should be updated by the provided methods.
   
4. setPosition, setScale have been updated to use the internal matrix representation 

5. the methods translate and rotate, rotateX, rotateY, rotateZ have been implemented

6. the method vxlActor._computeBoundingBox is called after geometric transformation operations

7. vxlScene will not invoke vxlActor._computeBoundingBox when the bounding box of the scene wants to be established.
In other words, each actor is responsible to keep its bounding box up to date

8. new method vxlActor.getBoundingBoxVertices, vxlActor.getBoundingBox

9. Some actor properties are made private ('_' prefix)

Camera Updates
---------------------
1. Tracking cameras reviewed and implemented

2. Camera to follow actor:

var camera = vxl.c.camera;
camera.setType(vxl.def.camera.type.TRACKING);
camera.follow(actor)

The camera needs to be positioned first. You can do:

camera.closeUp(actor)

then

camera.follow(actor)
Any actor translation will be applied to the camera 
Also, the camera has tracking modes (see the docs on vxl.def.camera.tracking)
 
3. New methods: roll, translate, closeUp, follow, unfollow

4. the shot method is made private (_shot). 

5. The camera variables are made private ('_' prefix)

vxlTrackerInteractor updates
------------------------------
1. Remember double click evokes current camera longShot method
2. Ctrl+Mouse is ZOOM
3. Shift + Ctrl + Mouse is ROLL

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.88 - Casablanca premiers in NYC
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Texture mapping has been implemented

2. The vxlActor and vxlModel classes have been updated to handle textures

3. There is a new class: vxlTexture to handle the texture loading and selecting the texture filters

4. The obj2json.py has been updated to handle textures

5. The texture file (png, jpg image) should have dimensions (width, height) that are power of 2 and
it should be in the same directory as the json file. 

6. Fullscreen implemented. Click on the view so it acquires the focus then 
press f (fullscreen) or x (exit fullscreen)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.87.6 - Spilberg's JAWS
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Lookup tables are loaded BY DEMAND instead of loading them all when Voxelent loads.
See vxl.api.loadLUTS 

2. Main folder structure has been simplified:
demos - docs - downloads - tools - source 

3. There is a new folder where I will put all the importers that I am working on: tools - importers

4. Default folders (vxl.def.lut.folder and vxl.def.model.folder) have been eliminated.
The developer needs to specify where relatively to voxelent.js location the assets are.
This applies for lookup tables and models. 

There is a new parameter to set the path for a list of models to load. Check the documentation for
vxl.api.load


5. try catch block added to JQuery detection (VXL.js)

6. The method vxl.api.subscribe has been added to the public API. 
Kamyar: please how to use this in your tutorial

7. Added support to render LINES! Check the cool DTI model in the VTK tutorial.

8. Camera API simplified

9. Dollying / Panning working nicely

10. Gimbal lock fixed using quaternions. Thanks tojiro!!

11. New Blender Program! now we can render blender objects (obj files + mtl files) --> JSON

12. Added idea of rendering strategies to decouple the interaction between scenes and programs.
We need to create a tutorial about this! It's reall cool!

13. getProperty and setProperty methods implemented in vxlActor. The scope determines what copy to pass
(model or actor property). We need to write a tutorial about this too.

14. New demo testing the actor cloning mechanism (see demo-lookup-table.html)

15. Publish/Subscribe mechanism updated for vxlNotifier

16. vxlBakeStrategy and vxlBakeProgram added. Working on improving rendering performance by interleaving buffers

17. Calculation of the bounding box is done BY DEMAND for performance reasons.

18. API docs have been improved
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.87.5 - Mother's Day
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The method setAutomaticResize(bool) is added to view. It will only work if the canvas is inside a div?

2. Each renderer calls the scene.render method and passes itself as an argument. In the last tests there are not collisions (nor flickering). 
We expected some issues here because we are multithreading the access to the GPU (using JavaScript intervals one per renderer)... Hmmm
let's see what the browsers vendors can do.

3. In the process of updating demos [not done yet] When done we will have the 0.88 version and then they will be available again in the website

4. Multi-view demo was added.

5. Voxelent uses now glMatrix! yay! Thank you Brandon.

6. The python packager generates the unminified and the minified voxelent lib.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.87 - Kitware Visit
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. The folder tutorials was renamed to demos
2. The demos were renamed to eliminate the word 'demo' from the filename
3. The demo hello.html and sphere.html were modified:
* hello.html adds one line to set up the camera to a reasonable distance
* sphere.html shows how the JS window object can listen for Voxelent events

4. python tools were renamed using the underscore instead of the dash. For instance:
vxl-documenter.py was renamed to vxl_documenter.py. The goal is to allow calling
modules from other python modules (not possible with a dash in the name of the module).

The new python module vxl_pack_and_document.py was created

5. The demos: picking, multiview and bouncing balls need to be updated with the latest 
voxelent version. They have OLD CODE.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.86 - Family Day
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. All the references to vxlAsseManager have been replaced by vxlModelManager. The goal of 
this change is to unify the ontology (Asset, Model).

2. vxl.def.asset has been merged into vxl.def.model

3. The method vxl.api.loadAssets has been changed to vxl.api.load

4. The uniform 'uUseLightTranslation' is set to true by default in the phong and diffuse shaders

5. vxlActor.setMode changed to vxlActor.setVisualizationMode

6. Tools are renamed from vox- to vxl- for naming consistency

7. vxlCameraInteractor disappears. vxlViewListener and vxlCameraInteractor are integrated into
vxlViewInteractor.

8. The folder view is created in the source code. It groups vxlView, vxlViewInteractor and the
interactors folder

9. The interactors now descend from vxlViewInteractor

10. vxlTrackballCameraInteractor is now known as vxlTrackerInteractor

11. vxlView has now the method setInteractor(i:vxlViewInteractor):void

12. Now the models and the actor names do not carry the suffix .json

13. vxlActor.setPosition and vxlActor.setScale are created

14. FOV, Z_NEAR and Z_FAR are now vxlCamera properties

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.85 - Diego's Birthday
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. Ambient Lights were removed from vxlView and vxl.api
This is an attribute that is dependent from the selected GLSL program and it should not be here.

2. The method vxlActor.clone was created. YAY!

3. The auxiliary Scene objects (vxlAxis, vxlBoundingBox, vxlFloor) were removed from the
actor list inside vxlScene so they do not interfere with actor counting and actor operations

4. The auxiliary Scene objects were encapsulated in a new class: vxlSceneToys

5. The vxlActor.setColor method was removed. Again, this is GLSL program dependent.
The more generic approach vxlActor.setProperty was created instead

6. The method vxlScene.setColor was removed with no replacement

7.vxlProgram was updated. The syntax to enable/disable attributes and to refer to attribute
pointers is simpler. Also the methods to register/load/use programs were updated.

8. vxl.api was updated. The name of methods that referred to Current Objects (vxl.c) was updated. 
For instance, instead of having vxl.api.getActiveCamera, now we have vxl.api.getCurrentCamera.
This improves consistency in the ontology of the API.

9. The documentation of the namespaces vxl, vxl.go, vxl.c, vxl.def and vxl.api was improved

10. Actors can now be translated and scaled

12. The code for vxlCamera was updated. The commented code that was not being used was removed

13. The folder structure of the library was updated to include: API docs, tutorials, and minified versions.

14. Actors can have different rendering programs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
VERSION 0.84 - The beatles arrive into JFK
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. First version to offer in the website
2. Support for multiple views accessing the same scene was included
3. DS_Store (Mac metafiles) were removed from source control
