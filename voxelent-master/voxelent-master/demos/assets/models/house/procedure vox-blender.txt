PROCEDURE TO IMPORT BLENDER MODELS INTO VOXELENT
----------------------------------------------------

1. Open the .blend file in Blender and make sure it is the model you want to import and that it looks good.

2. File>Export>Wavefront (obj)

3. Make sure you select the name and the directory where you want to store the obj and mtl files that will be generated by blender

4. These are the options for the Export OBJ panel:

- selection only: unckecked
- animation: unckecked
- apply modifiers: CHECKED
- include edges: unchecked
- include normals: unchecked
- include UVs: CHECKED
- write materials: CHECKED
- triangulate faces: CHECKED
- write nurbs: unchecked
- polygroups: unchecked
- objects as OBJ objects: CHECKED
- objects as OBJ groups: unchecked
- material groups: CHECKED
- keep vertex order: unchecked
- scale = 1.0
- forward: "-Z Forward"
- up: "Y Up"
- path mode: "Auto"

5. click on the "Export OBJ button" at the top of the screen.
 
6. quit blender

7. open a terminal window

8. Make sure that the importer obj2vxl.py is located on the same directory as the generated .obj and .mtl files

9. Make sure that the python interpreter is available in your console

10. run the following command:

python obj2json.py [file].obj [file].mtl

Replace [file] with the selected name file on step 3.

in the file manifesto.txt which is generated along with them.
